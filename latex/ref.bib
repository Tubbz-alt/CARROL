We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, improve on the previous best result in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build "fully convolutional" networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves improved segmentation of PASCAL VOC (30{\%} relative improvement to 67.2{\%} mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, SIFT Flow, and PASCAL-Context, while inference takes one tenth of a second for a typical image.},

abstract = {As a successful deep model applied in image super-resolution (SR), the Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) [1, 2] has demonstrated superior performance to the previous hand-crafted models either in speed and restoration quality. However, the high computational cost still hinders it from practical usage that demands real-time performance (24 fps). In this paper, we aim at accelerating the current SRCNN, and propose a compact hourglass-shape CNN structure for faster and better SR. We redesign the SRCNN structure mainly in three aspects. First, we introduce a deconvolution layer at the end of the network , then the mapping is learned directly from the original low-resolution image (without interpolation) to the high-resolution one. Second, we reformulate the mapping layer by shrinking the input feature dimension before mapping and expanding back afterwards. Third, we adopt smaller filter sizes but more mapping layers. The proposed model achieves a speed up of more than 40 times with even superior restoration quality. Further, we present the parameter settings that can achieve real-time performance on a generic CPU while still maintaining good performance. A corresponding transfer strategy is also proposed for fast training and testing across different upscaling factors.},

abstract = {Multi-frame super-resolution algorithms offer resolution enhancement for sequences of images with sampling limited resolution. However, classical approaches have been constrained by the accuracy of motion estimation while nonlocal approaches that use implicit motion estimation have attained only modest resolution improvement. In this paper, we propose a new multi-frame optical flow based super-resolution algorithm, which provides significant resolution enhancement for image sequences containing complex motion. The algorithm uses the standard camera image formation model and a variational super-resolution formulation with an anisotropic smoothness term adapting to local image structures. The key elements enabling super-resolution of complex motion patterns are the computation of two-way optical flow between the images and use of two corresponding uncertainty measures that approximate the optical flow interpolation error. Using the developed algorithm, we are able to demonstrate super-resolution of images for which optical flow estimation experiences near breakdown, due to the complexity of the motion patterns and the large magnitudes of the displacements. In comparison, we show that for these images some conventional super-resolution approaches fail, while others including nonlocal super-resolution technique produce distortions and provide lower (1-1.8dB) image quality enhancement compared to the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {Polygon-based representations of 3D objects offer resolution independence over a wide range of scales. With this approach, object boundaries remain sharp when we zoom in on an object until very close range, where faceting appears due to finite polygon size (see Figure 1). However, constructing polygon models for complex, real-world objects can be difficult. Image-based rendering (IBR), a complementary approach for representing and rendering objects, uses cameras to obtain rich models directly from real-world data. Unfortunately, these representations no longer have resolution independence. When we enlarge a bitmapped image, we get a blurry result. Figure 2 shows the problem for an IBR version of a teapot image, rich with real-world detail. Standard pixel interpolation methods, such as pixel replication (Figures 2b and 2c) and cubic-spline interpolation (Fig-ures 2d and 2e), introduce artifacts or blur edges. For images enlarged three octaves (fac-tors of two) such as these, sharpening the interpolated result has little useful effect (Figures 2f and 2g). We call methods for achieving high-resolution enlargements of pixel-based images super-resolution algorithms. Many applications in graphics or image processing could benefit from such resolution independence , including IBR, texture mapping, enlarging consumer photographs, and converting NTSC video content to high-definition television. We built on another training-based super-resolution algorithm 1 and developed a faster and simpler algorithm for one-pass super-resolution. (The one-pass, example-based algorithm gives the enlargements in Figures 2h and 2i.) Our algorithm requires only a nearest-neighbor search in the training set for a vector derived from each patch of local image data. This one-pass super-resolution algorithm is a step toward achieving resolution independence in image-based representations. We don't expect perfect resolution independence-even the polygon representation doesn't have that-but increasing the resolution independence of pixel-based representations is an important task for IBR. Example-based approaches Super-resolution relates to image interpolation-how should we interpolate between the digital samples of a photograph? Researchers have long studied this problem , although only recently with machine learning or sampling approaches. (See the "Related Approaches" sidebar for more details.) Three complimentary ways exist for increasing an image's apparent resolution: 0272-1716/02/{\$}17.00 1 (a) When we model an object with traditional polygon techniques, it lacks some of the richness of real-world objects but behaves properly under enlargement.
